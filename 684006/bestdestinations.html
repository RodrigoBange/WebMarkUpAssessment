                    <h4><strong>Holidays to the Algarve</strong></h4>
                    <p>Award-winning destination
                        The Algarve is a regular winner at the World Travel Awards – the travel 
                        industry’s answer to the Oscars. In fact, over the years, it’s taken home 
                        accolades for everything from its fabulous diving and great golf resorts to
                        its top-of-the-range attractions and sweeping beaches.                        
                        Standout coastline
                        If there’s one category this part of Portugal really deserves gold for, it’s 
                        the beaches. Hidden coves, crescent-shaped bays and rocky inlets make up the 
                        Algarve’s coastline. Most of the pale sands are child-friendly, plus many come 
                        with Blue Flag credentials.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Holidays to Benidorm</strong></h4>
                    <p>Benidorm's a bubbly seaside resort in the middle of Spain's eastern coast, 
                        which is often dubbed the Costa Blanca. And this place didn’t get to be one 
                        of Spain’s holiday behemoths for nothing. This town likes to flaunt its best 
                        assets – sandy beaches and fun-packed nights – but there’s another side to it,
                        too. Benidorm actually goes all the way back to 1325, so the winding, cobbled 
                        old town and Baroque domed church are as authentic as they come.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Holidays to Cancun</strong></h4>
                    <p>Mexican star
                        Back in the Seventies, Cancun was just a small fishing town on the northeast 
                        coast of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Today, it’s a huge resort that comes in 
                        two parts. There’s the downtown area with its markets and local cantinas, and 
                        then you’ve got the Hotel Zone that comes with restaurants, shopping malls and 
                        nightclubs – and an extra-long strip of beach. A beach that won’t run out
                        The sands that spool along the Hotel Zone go on and on – you’ve got 22 kilometres
                        at your disposal here. And you have a choice of beach territory, too.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Holidays to Crete</strong></h4>
                    <p>Crete subscribes to the bigger is better school of thought. Not only is it the 
                        largest of the Greek Islands, but it’s the fifth biggest island in the Mediterranean 
                        Sea – Corsica pips it to the fourth place post by just a few hundred acres. Crete’s 
                        super-size means it’s got 650 miles of coastline to go around. The beaches in the 
                        Lassithi area, to the east of the island, are annexes to the cosmopolitan towns of 
                        Agios Nikolaos and Elounda. Here, sunbathers can mix stints on the sunbed with 
                        shopping sprees and long lunches in the squares.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Holidays to Dubai</strong></h4>
                    <p>The Las Vegas of the Middle East
                        With the world’s tallest building, the world’s biggest shopping mall and the world’s 
                        biggest choreographed fountain, Dubai’s a city that breaks records for fun. 
                        Glamorous hotels on purpose-built islands and seven-figure yachts are all part of 
                        the fabric of the UAE’s answer to Tinsel Town. Its ever-evolving city centre’s just
                        one of the things that makes it a must-see. And because the skyline is always 
                        getting bigger and bolder, it’s not uncommon to see a spot of construction work 
                        going on around the city.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Holidays to Florida</strong></h4>
                    <p>When Walt Disney’s grand plans for Magic Kingdom were brought to life in Orlando back 
                        in the Seventies, it set the precedent for things to come. Today, the Sunshine State 
                        is the world leader when it comes to theme parks. There are no less than 15, 
                        including six Parks at Walt Disney World Resort, and other household names like 
                        Universal Orlando Resort, and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. With city-sized malls, 
                        world-class golf courses and more restaurants per head than any other US state, 
                        Florida pulls out all the stops to impress the millions of visitors it receives 
                        every year.</p>
